A trustworthy antispam plugin for Contact Form 7. Simple but effective.

== Description ==
Contact Form 7 Antispam - is an Anti-spam plugin that without boring you with configurations, filters out spam-bots with an auto-learning ai mechanism.
What the plugin does in detail:
- for first the plugin perform a quick, trasparent but effective check on the humanity of the sender (without i'm not a robot checkbox or something like that)
- Then the IP is checked to see if it is on any spammer blocklists
- After that it is analysed by a predictive algorithm that learns what is spam and what is not, so that as you receive spam your site learns to protect itself!

By the way nothing is perfect so if you don't want to loose any submitted mail you may want to install also [flamingo] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/)
Flamingo also is integrated with AntiSpam for Contact Form 7 and when you mark an email as spam (or ham) the intelligent algorithm learns again!

== Privacy Notices ==
AntiSpam for Contact Form 7 only process the ip but doesn't store any personal data, but anyway it creates a dictionary of spam and ham words in the wordpress database.
This database may contain words that are in the e-mail message, so can contain also personal data.
The purpose of this word collecting is to build a dictionary used for the spam detection.
