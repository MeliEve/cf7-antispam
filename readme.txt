A trustworthy antispam plugin for Contact Form 7. Simple but effective.

== Description ==
Contact Form 7 Antispam - is a new plugin that, without boring you with configurations, filters out spam-bots with an auto-learning ai mechanism.
Summarising:
- for first the plugin perform a quick, trasparent but effective check on the humanity of the sender (without i'm not a robot checkbox or something like that)
- Then the IP is checked to see if it is on any spammer blocklists
- After that it is analysed by a predictive algorithm that learns what is spam and what is not, so that as you receive spam your site learns to protect itself!

By the way nothing is perfect so if you don't want to loose any submitted mail you may want to install also [flamingo] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/)
Flamingo also is integrated with CF7 Antispam and when you mark an email as spam (or ham) the intelligent algorithm learns again!
